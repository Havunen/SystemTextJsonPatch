## 4.2.0

- Correctly handle key not found exception when applying patch document to dictionary https://github.com/Havunen/SystemTextJsonPatch/pull/40
- Respect STJ options PropertyNameCaseInsensitive setting https://github.com/Havunen/SystemTextJsonPatch/pull/42
- Internal dependencies updated

## 4.1.0

- Adds .NET 9 support

## 4.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGE:** SystemTextJsonPatch now supports different property naming policies!
f.e. `JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower`. Fixes https://github.com/Havunen/SystemTextJsonPatch/issues/36

- This means that the **path** and **from** of the system text json patch document needs to match the JSON serializer options property naming policy.
For example, if the JSON serializer options are set to use camelCase, the patch path should also be in camelCase.

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Exception types have been changed.

- `JsonPatchException` -base exception type now contains `FailedOperation` and `AffectedObject` properties.
These properties are populated with the failed operation when the operation is available.
This change is to provide more information about the failed operation and the affected object. Fixes: https://github.com/Havunen/SystemTextJsonPatch/issues/26
- `NotSupportedException` and `InvalidOperationException` are not thrown anymore. Instead, `JsonPatchException` is thrown with the appropriate message.
- `JsonPatchTestOperationException` is now thrown only when the test operation fails. Fixes https://github.com/Havunen/SystemTextJsonPatch/issues/22
